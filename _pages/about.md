I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Alan Turing Institute working on trustworthy machine learning and applying ML in healthcare. My strong background in mathematics (demonstrated in my dual undergraduate degree and my success in national and international mathematics competition) along with my extensive experience in information theory, equipped me well for the research in machine learning. I am passionate about problem solving and research on fundamental problems with real-life impact.

Research
======
I recently joined FAIR project at Turing working on responsible AI and in particular on synthetic data generation. Before that, I was part of the Learning Machine project working on the deployment of machine learning in high-stake applications like healthcare and the criminal justice system. We were particularly focused on monitoring the model for use for a long period (looking for different sorts of drifts). I was working with a group of research engineers and my role was helping with the design and implementation of the model. We have worked on a few datasets including the SEER dataset (for cancer research) and ADNI dataset (Alzheimer's disease). We have also collaborated with clinicians in our projects. I have worked on several problems related to the learning machine project including interpretability, fairness and privacy, and semi-supervised learning with covariate shift (see publications). Before joining Turing I was shortly a postdoc inÂ van der Schaar Lab at Cambridge (department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics) where I worked on treatment recommendations with missing values and also a short project on the application of ML in cystic fibrosis.

My research topic during my PhD and Master's studies was information theory. In my PhD, I worked on the problem of the insertion-deletion channel and file synchronization. My Master's thesis was on zero error coordination.
